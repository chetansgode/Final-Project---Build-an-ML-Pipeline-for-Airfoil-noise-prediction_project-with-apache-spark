Final Project Coursera Module Data Engineering for machine Learning using Apache Spark

Final Project Overview
Welcome to the final project of this course! In this project, i will work with the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. The goal is to clean the dataset, create a Machine Learning pipeline, evaluate the model's performance, and persist it for future use. 

You will begin by cleaning the dataset and removing duplicate rows and rows with null values. Doing this step ensures the data is consistent and reliable for further analysis. Next, you will construct a Machine Learning pipeline with three stages, including a regression stage. This pipeline will enable you to build a model that predicts the SoundLevel based on other columns in the dataset. Once youâ€™ve trained the model, you will evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and effectiveness. Finally, you will persist with the model, saving it for future use. This step ensures that the trained model can be stored and retrieved later, enabling its deployment in real-world applications and making predictions on new data. 

There are four parts to this project. In part one, you will perform ETL activities, including loading the CSV dataset, cleaning it, applying transformations, and storing the cleaned data in the parquet format. Part two involves creating the Machine Learning pipeline, which forms the backbone of your model development. In part three, you will evaluate the model using relevant metrics to gain insights into its performance. Finally, in part four, you will save the model for future production use and verify its successful loading. 

By the end of this project, you will have gained practical experience in working with real-world datasets, developing machine learning pipelines, evaluating models, and persisting them for future use. Let's get started!
